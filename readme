Knn algorithm
Here are some possible **viva questions** related to **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification** and **machine learning concepts**, along with their answers:

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Basic KNN Questions**
#### **1. What is K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
KNN is a **supervised learning algorithm** used for **classification and regression**. It works by finding the **k nearest neighbors** of a data point and assigning the most common class among them.

---

#### **2. How does KNN work?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
1. Choose a value for **k** (number of neighbors).  
2. Calculate the **distance** (e.g., Euclidean distance) between the new data point and all training samples.  
3. Select the **k nearest neighbors**.  
4. Assign the most **frequent class** (for classification) or **average value** (for regression).  

---

#### **3. What is the role of k in KNN?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
- `k` controls how many neighbors **influence the prediction**.
- **Low k (e.g., k=1)** â†’ More sensitive to noise (**overfitting**).  
- **High k (e.g., k=20)** â†’ More generalized but may lead to **underfitting**.  
- We **tune k** to find the best performance.

---

#### **4. How do you choose the best k in KNN?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
We select `k` by:
- Testing multiple values and choosing the one with **highest accuracy**.
- Using **cross-validation** to find the optimal value.
- A common rule of thumb: **k â‰ˆ sqrt(n)** (where `n` is the number of samples).

---

#### **5. What distance metrics are used in KNN?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
1. **Euclidean Distance** â†’ Most common  
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
   \]
2. **Manhattan Distance** â†’ For grid-based data  
   \[
   d = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|
   \]
3. **Minkowski Distance** â†’ General form of both  
4. **Cosine Similarity** â†’ For text data  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Model Training and Evaluation Questions**
#### **6. Why do we split data into training and testing sets?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
To evaluate model performance.  
- **Training set** â†’ Used to train the model.  
- **Test set** â†’ Used to measure how well the model generalizes to unseen data.  

A common split is **80% training, 20% testing**.

---

#### **7. What does the `train_test_split()` function do?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
It **randomly splits** data into **training and test sets** based on the given `test_size` and `random_state`.  
```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```
- `test_size=0.2` â†’ 20% for testing, 80% for training.
- `random_state=42` â†’ Ensures reproducibility.

---

#### **8. Why do we use `LabelEncoder()` in machine learning?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
- Converts **categorical labels** (e.g., "Malignant", "Benign") into **numerical values** (e.g., `0`, `1`).
- Many ML models require numerical inputs.

Example:
```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
y = label_encoder.fit_transform(y)
```

---

#### **9. What is `accuracy_score()` in KNN?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
It measures **how many predictions were correct** out of total predictions.
\[
\text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Predictions}}
\]

Example:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
```

---

#### **10. What are some evaluation metrics for classification models?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
1. **Accuracy** â†’ Overall correctness  
2. **Precision** â†’ Correct positive predictions  
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)** â†’ Correctly identified positives  
4. **F1-Score** â†’ Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall  
5. **Confusion Matrix** â†’ Shows TP, FP, FN, TN

### **ðŸ”¹ KNN vs Other ML Algorithms**
#### **11. How does KNN differ from decision trees?**
| Feature | KNN | Decision Tree |
|---------|----|---------------|
| **Type** | Instance-based (lazy) | Model-based (eager) |
| **Training Time** | Slow | Fast |
| **Prediction Time** | Fast | Slow |
| **Works well with** | Small datasets | Large datasets |

---

#### **12. Is KNN sensitive to outliers?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
Yes! Since KNN relies on **distance calculations**, outliers can **skew predictions**.  
**Solution**: Use normalization (`MinMaxScaler`) or remove outliers.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Optimization and Improvements**
#### **13. How can we improve KNN performance?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
- **Feature Scaling** (Standardization/Normalization)  
- **Choosing optimal k value**  
- **Using KD-Tree or BallTree** (for faster search)  
- **Handling missing values**  

---

#### **14. What is the time complexity of KNN?**
ðŸ“Œ **Answer:**  
- **Training Time** â†’ **O(1)** (No actual training)  
- **Prediction Time** â†’ **O(n Ã— d)** (for n samples, d dimensions)  
This makes KNN **slow** for large datasets.

---

#### **15. What are the advantages and disadvantages of KNN?**
| **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Simple to implement | Slow for large datasets |
| No need for training | Sensitive to irrelevant features |
| Works well with small data | Affected by imbalanced data |
| Handles multi-class classification | Memory-intensive |
